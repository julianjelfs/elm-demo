# Demo Elm Project

### To get this demo running

Make sure that you have Elm 0.18 installed. 

```
npm install elm -g
```

Make sure you have create-alm-app installed

```
npm install create-elm-app -g
```

Clone the repo and cd into the directory. Then run 

```
elm-app start
```

That should start up a dev server and run the site which should recompile and
reload automatically when you save any files.

### What is Elm

Strongly typed, pure functional programming language. Fixes a lot of the problems that exist with JS.

* no mutation
* referentially transparent aka pure
* sound type system
* very predictable and reliable

I intend to do a more in depth talk on the value of FP, but for now we're going to take it as 
read that it's a good idea. In _this_ talk, I just want to get straight into the code and show
you how it works and how to get stuff done.
